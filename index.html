This is a little tool to work out how long it would take a person to read your text. By telling folk the time it will take to read something it allows them to see whether or not they can expend time and energy right now to read the thing, or whether they should save it for later.

The calculation assumes that the average person reads 200 words per minute. This is likely not the case for many people depending on fatigue level, cognitive ability, day of the week, interest level, age and more.

No calculation is done for complexity of the subject matter. It's good practice to write simple sentences so your content can be enjoyed by all.
